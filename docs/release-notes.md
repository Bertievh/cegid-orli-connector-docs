# Release Notes Cegid Orii 25.0

## General

The release supports Cegid Orli version 25.1.

This is a complete rewrite of the Cegid Orli connector removing the SOAP web services requests replacing them with 
Rest-API calls using SOAP data structures. 

Authentication is performed by retrieving an authorization token and then setting the value in the header of the Rest-API call.

The information is passed using a POST method and using XML soapenv Envelopes.

Returned XML data is parsed using the XPATH library.

## Migration Considerations

The configuration has changed and requires the new URL's as well as the authentication information required to retrieve a token for subsequent use.
